# To Do App
An easy to use and understand app for tracking everyday tasks.

## About
This app was made using HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript on Front End, and NodeJS + Express + MongoDB for Back End.
It performs CRUD operations.

## How does it work?

- The app is rendered after requesting saved tasks to the Database, showing them on screen.
- Tasks added via user input are saved on MongoDB Atlas.
- Task status can be modified via the green icon to the right. Completed quests receive the 'text-decoration: line-through' property.
- Tasks can be deleted using the red cross.

## API

The app also serves tasks in json format. Check window.location.href/data
